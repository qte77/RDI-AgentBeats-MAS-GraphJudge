# AgentBeats Scenario Configuration
# Based on: https://github.com/RDI-Foundation/agentbeats-leaderboard-template
#
# IMPORTANT: agentbeats_id values are assigned by the AgentBeats platform
# after agent registration. These remain empty until deployment.
# See docs/AgentBeats/AGENTBEATS_REGISTRATION.md for registration process.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Register agents on agentbeats.dev
# 2. Copy assigned IDs (format: "agent_xyz123abc456")
# 3. Update this file before platform submission
