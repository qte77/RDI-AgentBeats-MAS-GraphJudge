# Runtime Output Directory
#
# This directory is used as a Docker volume mount for runtime output.
# Files written here during agent execution:
# - results.json - Primary evaluation results (REQUIRED)
# - provenance.json - Build metadata (auto-generated by workflow)
#
# NOTE: This directory is typically ignored by Git (.gitignore).
# The workflow copies results.json to results/ directory for leaderboard submission.
