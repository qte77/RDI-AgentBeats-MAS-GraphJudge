# Runtime Output Directory
#
# Used for all agent evaluation outputs (local dev and platform runs).
# Agent writes to output/results.json by default (configurable via GREEN_OUTPUT_FILE).
#
# Files written here:
# - results.json - Evaluation results (written by agent)
# - provenance.json - Build metadata (auto-generated by workflow on platform)
#
# For AgentBeats platform runs:
# - Docker mounts this directory as a volume
# - Workflow copies results.json to results/ for leaderboard submission
#
# This directory is gitignored (runtime outputs only).
